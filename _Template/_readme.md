The idea of these is for a response. It's in your best interest to create these yourself, copy pasting the response and automating predefinted fields.

*For example. 

1.) *Ticket Closed = Sends Contact msg with copy paste template ; sets status to closed ; fills an other fields as required.*

2.) *Follow Up = Sends contact copy paste msg ; sets status to Waiting on response ; done*
