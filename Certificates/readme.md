+ LetEnc is the powershell version of the certificate script.      

+ Httpsc2doneright is for linux, but I've only ever used in under specific cirumstances.    

```sh     
curl 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Calvindd2f/Proactive-Issues/main/Certificates/httpsc2doneright.sh' --output 'httpsc2doneright.sh' && chmod +X ./httpsc2doneright.sh && ./$_ 
```
